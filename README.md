# E-Commerce Sales & Profitability Analysis

## Project Background

E-commerce companies operate in an increasingly competitive environment where revenue growth alone is no longer sufficient. Rising acquisition costs, aggressive discounting strategies, increasing return rates, and operational expenses continue to put pressure on profitability.Understanding what drives revenue, how margin is impacted by pricing and promotions, and where operational inefficiencies exist is critical for sustainable growth and informed decision-making.

This project analyzes a two-year transactional e-commerce dataset (2024–2025) to examine revenue trends, profitability drivers, channel performance, product lifecycle contribution, and operational cost structure.

The analysis integrates data modeling, ETL processes, SQL-based business querying, and executive-level dashboard design to translate raw transactional data into strategic business insight.

The analysis focuses on the following key areas:
- Executive Overview - Provides a high-level view of revenue performance, order trends, and core financial KPIs. Highlights year-over-year changes in revenue, average order value, profit margin, and return rate to support executive decision-making.
- Revenue & Product Performance - Examines how revenue is distributed across product categories and lifecycle stages to identify growth drivers and structural dependencies within the product portfolio.
- Channel & Campaign Effectiveness - Analyzes performance across sales channels and marketing campaign types to assess differences in revenue contribution, customer behavior, and profitability impact.
- Profitability & Cost Structure - Breaks down revenue into key cost components — including discounts, shipping, payment fees, and tax — to identify the primary drivers of margin compression.
- Operational Performance & Returns - Evaluates delivery efficiency and return rate trends to uncover operational pressures and their influence on overall profitability.

A structured analytics workflow supports data ingestion, transformation, and analysis:

- Python for ETL workflows, including data cleaning, validation, and feature engineering
- PostgreSQL for analytics-oriented data modeling and SQL-based analysis
- Power-BI for interactive dashboards and executive-level data storytelling

An Interective Tableau Dashboard are available [here.](https://app.powerbi.com/groups/me/reports/26c7b30e-7198-4acb-95b3-d572de588e32/f77a97c078697c2b0fc0?experience=power-bi)

SQL queries for data modeling and business analysis are available [here]

Python scripts used for data preparation and transformation are available [here].

## Data Structure & Initial Checks
The dataset follows a star-schema structure optimized for revenue analysis, profitability diagnostics, channel performance evaluation, and product-level benchmarking.

## Business Questions

This analysis is designed to address the following business questions:

- What are the primary drivers of revenue decline and margin compression?
- How does discount intensity impact overall profitability?
- Which product categories and lifecycle stages contribute most to total revenue?
- How do different sales channels and campaign types compare in terms of revenue quality and average order value?
- To what extent do return behavior and operational costs (shipping, payment fees, tax) affect net profit?

## Executive Overview

### Insights & Business Implications

#### Key Insights
 - Total revenue declined year-over-year despite relatively stable order volume, indicating pressure on pricing and customer spend.
 - Average Order Value (AOV) decreased significantly, contributing more to revenue decline than volume loss.
 - Profit margin compressed faster than revenue, signaling structural profitability pressure.
 - Return rate showed a modest upward trend, increasing margin risk.

#### Potential Actions
 - Reassess discount strategy to protect average order value.
 - Identify customer segments driving lower AOV and adjust pricing tiers.
 - Investigate return drivers to prevent further margin erosion..
